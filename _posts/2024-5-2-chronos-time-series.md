 Chronos, a language modeling framework minimally adapted for time series forecasting. Chronos tokenizes time series into discrete bins through simple scaling and quantization of real values.

 Mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) is a data augmentation scheme pro- posed in the context of image classification. It generates convex combinations of random image pairs and their labels from the training dataset, which alleviates issues such as memorization and overfitting in deep learning models.
